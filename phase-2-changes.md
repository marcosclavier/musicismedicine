About Music Is Medicine 

Music Is Medicine is a heartfelt Canadian music initiative created by Robert Frances, CEO of PEAK Financial Group and member of the band N2O. 

After losing a close bandmate to brain cancer, Robert turned that loss into purpose. Together with Alan Parsons, he launched Music Is Medicine to use the power of music to raise awareness, support research, and offer hope to families across Canada. 

Every stream, download, and share contributes to the mission, with net proceeds donated to the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, helping fund research, advocacy, and patient support. 



Why Music Is Medicine Matters 

When a song becomes a source of healing

Brain tumours like glioblastoma affect thousands of families every year. Research brings hope, but it needs awareness and funding. 

Through Music Is Medicine, sound becomes support — transforming music into meaningful action.
