### Overview of Music is Medicine
Music is Medicine is a charitable initiative focused on raising funds for brain cancer research through benefit concerts and related events. It is organized by PEAK Financial Group, a Montreal-based independent financial services firm, and operates as a fundraising platform rather than a standalone registered charity. All proceeds from its events are directed to support research at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital), part of McGill University Health Centre. The initiative emphasizes the healing power of music, transforming it into a tool for advancing medical research, better treatments, and hope for brain cancer patients and their families.

### Founding and Robert Frances' Role
The initiative was created by Robert Frances, the President and CEO of PEAK Financial Group. Frances, a Montreal resident, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma (a aggressive form of brain cancer) around 2020. During his treatment and recovery, he found solace and healing in music, which inspired him to launch Music is Medicine to give back to the medical community that saved his life. As a brain cancer survivor, Frances serves as the lead organizer and visionary, turning his personal passion for music into a purposeful movement for research funding. He has described the initiative as evolving from a personal coping mechanism to a broader effort with lasting impact, stating, "Today, it has purpose."

### History and Purpose
Launched in the early 2020s following Frances' diagnosis, Music is Medicine began as a response to the challenges of brain cancer treatment and the need for more research. Its core purpose is to fund clinical trials and studies at The Neuro, aiming to uncover the causes of brain cancer, develop innovative therapies, and improve patient outcomes. The initiative operates under PEAK's #PEAKWithPurpose banner, which promotes community impact. It has grown from a single event into an annual benefit, fostering partnerships with sponsors and collaborators to amplify its reach.

### Key Events and Activities
- **Inaugural Event (May 14, 2024)**: A sold-out benefit concert at Théâtre Maisonneuve in Place des Arts, Montreal, headlined by Grammy-winning producer and musician Alan Parsons (known for his work with The Beatles and Pink Floyd). The event featured live performances and was described as a "brilliant" fusion of music and philanthropy.
- **Upcoming Event (May 14, 2025)**: Another concert at the same venue, again featuring Alan Parsons Live Project. Tickets range from standard to VIP packages, with sponsorship opportunities available. Donations are tax-receiptable through McGill University.
- Additional activities include collaborations like a forthcoming charity album recorded by Alan Parsons in Montreal, extending the initiative's mission beyond live events.

### Impact and Funds Raised
The 2024 event raised over $500,000, which is being used to launch four new clinical trials at The Neuro focused on brain cancer causes and treatments. This has generated new data, research advancements, and renewed hope for affected families. Overall, the initiative has mobilized community support, corporate sponsorships, and awareness, with plans for continued growth.

### Partnerships and Sponsors
Music is Medicine partners closely with The Neuro for research funding. Major sponsors include National Bank (collaborating sponsor), gold-level supporters like Groupe Deschenes and Air Canada, and others such as TD Bank, CN, and Sun Life. These partnerships provide financial backing and promotional support.

Note that while there are other organizations worldwide using similar names (e.g., music therapy groups), this specific initiative is the Montreal-based one tied to Robert Frances and brain cancer research.

Navigation menu at the top with links to each section, plus a sticky CTA button for "Listen Now" and "Donate" that appears on scroll.
